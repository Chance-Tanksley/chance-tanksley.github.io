    <h3>A Bit About Me</h3>
    <p class="one">
      My name is Chance Tanksley. I am 21 years old going on to 22 in August. I am a full stack software developer in
      Starkville, MS. I just recently completed my certificate program at
      Mississippi Coding Academy in July of 2023 and I am looking for work. I work well with
      a team and have a good work ethic. I have been working at Umi Japanese
      Steakhouse & Sushi Bar in Columbus, Ms for the past 3 years, started as a host, and worked my way through the ranks until I became
      a manager in 2023. I have a very relaxed personality which helps me get along well with others. 

    </p>

    <h3>My Recent Projects!</h3>
    <div class="projects">
      <div class="asciiGen">
        <h4><a href="https://github.com/Chance-Tanksley/AsciiGenerator"> Ascii Generator </a ></h4>
        <img
          src="Pictures/Ascii.Before.png"
          alt="My ascii generator before asciitizing"
          title="Ascii Generator Before"
          width="250"
          height="250"
        />
        <img
          src="Pictures/Ascii.After.png"
          alt="My ascii generator after asciitizing"
          title="Ascii Generator After"
          width="250"
          height="250"
        />
        <p>
          The Ascii Generator takes an image and user inputed kernals to then turn the image into a string image
          consisting of different characters as the pixels.

      <div class="Encoder//Decoder">
        <h4><a href="https://github.com/Chance-Tanksley/Encoder-Decoder">Encoder // Decoder</a></h4>
        <img
          src="Pictures/Encoder.JPG"
          alt="My Encoder Project"
          title="Encoder"
          width="500"
          height="400"
        />
        <img
          src="Pictures/Decoder.JPG"
          alt="My Decoder Project"
          title="Decoder"
          width="650"
          height="400"
        />
        <p>
          The Encoder project takes a ppm file coverts it to a bitmap and hides a
          message within the pixels of the bitmap then converts it back to a ppm
          file for the user to save. The Deocoder project takes the saved ppm
          and finds the message and displays it in all caps.

        <P>
          The Kiosk project is a self-checkout console project that 
          runs through a customer's 
          experience of "scanning" items and then determining if
          the customer would like to pay with cash or card and if 
          they would like cashback or not. Depending on what the customer choose the kiosk will act accordingly.
